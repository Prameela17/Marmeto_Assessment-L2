This project involves creating a tab switching layout using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The layout should display product cards based on the selected category, with dynamic product badges and images fetched from an API. Each product card should include details such as product title, vendor name, price, compare at price, and calculated discount in percentage. Additionally, there should be a dummy "Add to Cart" button. The tab switching mechanism should toggle between "Men," "Women," and "Kids" tabs, updating the displayed product cards accordingly.
